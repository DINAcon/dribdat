<p>When documenting a project, you can use <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet" target="_blank">Markdown formatting</a> in the <b>Description</b>, as well as several customisation options, like an icon, color and image, that appear after you create a project and then try to edit it. You will also be able to update your progress level.</p>
<p>It is also possible to publish your project in an open source community site. If you start a project on <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://bitbucket.org" target="_blank">Bitbucket</a> or <a href="http://make.opendata.ch/wiki/project:home" target="_blank">DokuWiki</a>, you can quickly and easily sync it into Dribdat by entering its link and enabling "auto-update".</p>
<p>You will then find a <a href="#" class="btn btn-warning disabled btn-sm">Sync</a> button at the bottom of your project page for quickly pulling in changes.</p>
<p>Any team members who you would like to list can <b>Join</b> the project by clicking a button at the top of your project page. Their public profile will then be linked to it, and they will also be able to make changes to the project data.</p>
<p>We encourage project teams to state their needs and roadblocks using the <b>Community</b> tools built into Dribdat. At the bottom of each project page (if your administrator has set it up), you will be able to make announcements on social platforms. By updating your status, you will also help communicate how far along you are in development, and help hackathon organisers channel their efforts using project scores.</p>
<p>Need more help? Get in touch with the organising team using the <b>Community</b> link above, or visit the <a href="https://forum.schoolofdata.ch/c/q-and-a">School of Data forum</a>.</p>
