<p>When documenting an idea or project, you can use <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet" target="_blank">Markdown formatting</a> in the <b>Description</b>. It is also possible to publish your documentation in an open source community site. If you host your project on <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com" target="_blank">GitLab</a>, or <a href="https://bitbucket.org" target="_blank">Bitbucket</a>, and online document editors including <a href="http://etherpad.org" target="_blank">Etherpad Lite</a>, Google Docs (File > Publish > Link), <a href="http://make.opendata.ch/wiki/project:home" target="_blank">DokuWiki</a> (experimental support), you can quickly and easily sync the details here by entering an <b>Autofill link</b> and enabling "auto-update". You will then find a <a href="#" class="btn btn-warning disabled btn-sm">Sync</a> button on your project page for quickly pulling in changes.</p>

<p>After you create a project, you can customise the icon, color and image. You will also be able to set your project status. By updating your <b>Progress</b>, you can communicate how far along you are in development, and hackathon participants and organisers can better channel their efforts to support you through the project dashboard. Your team members can click the <a href="#" class="btn btn-default disabled btn-sm">Join</a> button at the top of your project page to link their profile and make changes.</p>
