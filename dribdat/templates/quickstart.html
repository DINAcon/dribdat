<p>When documenting a project, you can use <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet" target="_blank">Markdown formatting</a> in the <b>Description</b>, as well as several customisation options, like an icon, color and image, that appear after you create a project and then try to edit it. You will also be able to update your progress level. Any team members can subscribe to the project once you have started it. Their public profile will then be linked to it, and they will also be able to make changes to the project data.</p>
<p>Just click the <a href="#" class="btn btn-default disabled btn-sm">Join</a> button at the top of your project page to do this.</p>
<p>It is also possible to publish your project in an open source community site. If you host your project on <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://bitbucket.org" target="_blank">Bitbucket</a> or <a href="http://make.opendata.ch/wiki/project:home" target="_blank">DokuWiki</a>, you can quickly and easily sync it's details here by entering an <b>Autofill link</b> and enabling "auto-update".</p>
<p>You will then find a <a href="#" class="btn btn-warning disabled btn-sm">Sync</a> button on your project page for quickly pulling in changes.</p>
<p>We encourage participants to state their needs and roadblocks using this tool. At the bottom of each project page (if your administrator has set it up), you will be able to make announcements on social platforms. By updating your <b>project status</b>, you can communicate how far along you are in development, and hackathon organisers can better channel their efforts to support you through the project dashboard.</p>
<p>Need more help? Get in touch with the organising team using the <b>Community</b> link above, or raise a <a href="https://github.com/loleg/dribdat/issues" target="_blank">GitHub issue</a>.</p>
