      <p>This is an open source project board designed for splendid collaboration. On this site we <b>collect and showcase all projects</b> from a hackathon event in one place.</p>
      <p>The name is an amalgam of <i>Driven By Data</i>: we started this platform to help hackathon teams sustain their efforts, streamline things for the organisers, and let everyone focus on driving their ideas forward instead of managing IT.</p>
      <h3>Quickstart</h3>
      <p>On the <a href="/">front page</a> you can see the upcoming event, as well as any previous events. A short description is followed by a link to the official home page, challenges and any projects submitted, as well as a countdown of time remaining until the start or finish (if already started) of the hackathon.</p>
      <p>The <a href="#" class="btn btn-default disabled">Projects &amp; Challenges</a> page is the home of the hackathon. Here you can learn about topics, datasets, and any other information the organisers have provided. Once you have formed a team, you can <a href="#" class="btn btn-success disabled">Start a project</a> after setting up a <a href="/register/">user account</a>.</p>
      <p>When documenting a project, you can use <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet" target="_blank">Markdown formatting</a> here, or publish your project using one of the supported open source communities. If you start a project on <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://bitbucket.org" target="_blank">Bitbucket</a> or <a href="http://make.opendata.ch/wiki/project:home" target="_blank">DokuWiki</a>, you can quickly and easily sync it into Dribdat by entering its link and enabling "auto-update". Then you will find a <a href="#" class="btn btn-warning disabled">Sync</a> button at the bottom of your project page for quickly pulling your changes in.</p>
      <p>Each project team can pick from one of the announced categories/challenges, or leave the category unspecified. You can state and update anytime the progress level of your project, as well as pick a color and icon to represent yourselves with. Any team members who you would like to list can <b>JOIN</b> the project by clicking the button at the top of your project page. Their public profile will then be linked to it.</p>
      <p>We encourage project teams to state their needs and roadblocks using the <b>Community</b> tools built into Dribdat. At the bottom of each project page (if your administrator has set it up), you will be able to make announcements on social platforms. By updating your status, you will also help communicate how far along you are in development, and help hackathon organisers channel their efforts using project scores.</p>
      <p>Need more help? Get in touch with the organising team using the <b>Community</b> link above, or visit the <a href="https://forum.schoolofdata.ch/c/q-and-a">School of Data forum</a>.</p>
      <h3>For organisers</h3>
      <p>All of the content on the site, including presentation of the header, can be edited by the site administrator in the <b>Admin</b> menu linked in the header if you have access: from where you can edit general details under <b>Events</b>, publish challenges in <b>Categories</b>, and edit or sync <b>Projects</b>.</p>
      <p>If you would like to use this platform for your event,
        contact the organisers of the events listed here and they
        should be able to help you - or just fork our open source project
        and set it up to your liking.</p>
