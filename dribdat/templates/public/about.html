      <p>This is an open source project board designed for splendid collaboration. On this site we <b>collect and showcase all projects</b> from a hackathon event in one place.</p>
      <p>The name is an amalgam of <i>Driven By Data</i>: we started this platform to help hackathon teams sustain their efforts, streamline things for the organisers, and let everyone focus on driving their ideas forward instead of managing IT.</p>
      <p>On the <a href="/">front page</a> you can see the upcoming event, as well as any previous events. A short description is followed by a link to the official home page, challenges and any projects submitted, as well as a countdown of time remaining until the start or finish (if already started) of the hackathon.</p>
      <p>The <a href="#" class="btn btn-default disabled">Projects &amp; Challenges</a> page is the home of the hackathon. Here you can learn about topics, datasets, and any other information the organisers have provided. Once you have formed a team, you can <a href="#" class="btn btn-success disabled">Start a project</a> after setting up a <a href="/register/">user account</a>.</p>
      
      <h3>Quickstart</h3>

      <h3>For organisers</h3>
      <p>All of the content on the site, including presentation of the header, can be edited by the site administrator in the <b>Admin</b> menu linked in the header if you have access: from where you can edit general details under <b>Events</b>, publish challenges in <b>Categories</b>, and edit or sync <b>Projects</b>.</p>
      <p>If you would like to use this platform for your event,
        contact the organisers of the events listed here and they
        should be able to help you - or just fork our open source project
        and set it up to your liking.</p>
