      <p>This is an open source project board designed for splendid collaboration. On this site we <b>collect and showcase all projects</b> from a hackathon event in one place. The name is an amalgam of <i>Driven By Data</i>: we started this platform to help hackathon teams sustain their efforts, streamline things for the organisers, and let everyone focus on driving their ideas forward instead of managing IT.</p>
    </div><div class="row">
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>On the <a href="/">front page</a> you can see the upcoming event, as well as any previous events. A short description is followed by a link to the event home page, as well as a countdown of time remaining until the start or finish (if already started) of the hackathon.</p>
      <p>The <b>Projects, Challenges and Resources</b> are shown on the event home page. Here you can learn about topics, datasets, and any other information the organisers have provided. Once the event has started, and you have formed a team, you can <a href="/register/">login</a> and <a href="#" class="btn btn-success disabled">Share project</a></p>

      <h3>For organisers</h3>
      <p>All of the content on the site, including presentation of the header, can be edited by the site administrator in the <b>Admin</b> menu linked in the header if you have access: from where you can edit general details under <b>Events</b>, publish <b>Categories</b>, and edit or sync <b>Projects</b> and <b>Challenges</b> (which are either a Category, or just a project in challenge status).</p>
      <p>If you would like to use this platform for your event,
        contact the organisers of the events listed here and they
        should be able to help you - or just fork the open source project
        and set it up to your liking:</p>
