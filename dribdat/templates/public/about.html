      <p>This is an open source project board designed for splendid collaboration. With this app you can collect and showcase all projects from an event in one place.</p>
      <p>The name is an amalgam of <i>Driven By Data</i>: we started this platform to help hackathon teams sustain their efforts, streamline things for the organisers, and let everyone focus on driving their ideas forward instead of managing IT.</p>
      <h1>Quickstart</h1>
      <p>On the <a href="/">front page</a> you can see the upcoming event, as well as any previous events. A short description is followed by a link to the official home page, the Challenges and any projects submitted, as well as a countdown of time remaining until the start or finish (if already started) of the hackathon.</p>
      <p>The <a href="#" class="btn btn-default">Projects &amp; Challenges</a> page is the home of the hackathon. Here you can learn about topics, datasets, and any other information the organisers have provided. Once you have formed a team, you can <a href="#" class="btn btn-success">Start a project</a> after setting up a <a href="/register/">user account</a>.</p>
      <p>When documenting a project, you can use Dribdat directly or one of the supported open source communities. If you start a project on <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://bitbucket.org" target="_blank">Bitbucket</a> or <a href="http://make.opendata.ch/wiki/project:home" target="_blank">DokuWiki</a>, you can quickly and easily sync it into Dribdat simply by entering the link to it and enabling "auto-update". Then you will find a <a href="#" class="btn btn-warning">Sync</a> button at the bottom of your project page for quickly pulling your changes in.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>All of the content on the site, including presentation of the header, can be edited by the site administrator in the <b>Admin</b> menu linked in the header if you have access: from where you can edit general details under <b>Events</b>, publish challenges in <b>Categories</b>, and edit or sync <b>Projects</b>.</p>
      <p>If you would like to use this platform for your event,
        contact the organisers of the events listed here and they
        should be able to help you - or just fork our open source project
        and set it up to your liking.</p>
